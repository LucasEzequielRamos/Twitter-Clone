# Twitter Clone

This project was to reinforce some bases and learn new technologies. It is a clone of the social network Twitter with some of its functionalities. I use the technologies of NextJS, Prisma ORM, MySQL, Tailwind. Implemented use of Next Auth to handle authorization and session cookies. I implement server actions with fetch to my api routes, with header management and custom server responses.
